            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage
            
            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback by following the best practices:
            - Build software that is **simple (KISS), duplication-free (DRY), only whatâ€™s needed (YAGNI) and structurally SOLID**.
            - Design every component with clear separation of concerns, high cohesion and low coupling; surprise no one (Principle of Least Astonishment), talk only to friends (Law of Demeter), hide volatile details, defend with robust validations, and run with least-privilege access.
            - **Drive development with tests first (TDD), fail fast, keep the main branch continuously integrated and green, and leave the code cleaner than you found it with every commit (Boy-Scout Rule)**.
            - Follow [our coding standards](../../CLAUDE.md)
